# Origamo Journal

## 2026-01-23
- Initialized local Git repository.
- Added `.gitignore` for macOS and editor artifacts.
- Built the single-mode shape playground with draggable vertices, point add/remove, rotation, and kinetic trace.
- Added discovery layers: soft symmetry constraints, depth hull, angle echoes, ghost memories, morph seeds, and surprise blooms.
- Kept everything offline-ready (HTML + Canvas + vanilla JS).
