# Origamo Journal

## 2026-01-23
- Initialized local Git repository.
- Added `.gitignore` for macOS and editor artifacts.
- Built the single-mode shape playground with draggable vertices, point add/remove, rotation, and kinetic trace.
- Added discovery layers: soft symmetry constraints, depth hull, angle echoes, ghost memories, morph seeds, and surprise blooms.
- Kept everything offline-ready (HTML + Canvas + vanilla JS).

## 2026-01-23 (cont.)
- Added whisper layers: after-touch glow, edge whispers, loop-settle, quiet orbit, balance tension, energy breathing.
- Tuned breath to avoid overshrink; separated seed click from breath hold.
- Added excitation state with visual emission glow + audio shimmer.
- Adjusted emission to trigger on cooling threshold for a cleaner "energy release" cue.
- Added edge wrap portals for tracer wrap-around and removed debug HUD.
- Added edge-wrap glow rings and cleanup for wrap portal effects.
- Added mobile long-press delete and double-tap add-point handling.
- Added wrap-around portal rings at screen edges.
- Strengthened touch event prevention to block iOS selection popups.
