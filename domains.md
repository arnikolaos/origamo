# Origamo Domains

This file defines the future domains that will reuse the Origamo core engine.
Each domain is a themed implementation layer on top of the shared engine.

## Domain Template

- Core behaviors to emphasize:
- Visual language notes:
- Sound notes:
- Interaction twists (optional):
- Outputs or artifacts (optional):

## Proposed Domains (Foldered)
Each domain lives in its own folder under `domains/`.

1) Geometry (`domains/geometry/`)
- Goal: baseline geometric interpretation for reference.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: symmetry gravity, loop settle, emission wave.
- Visual language notes: minimal, precise lines with soft glow.
- Sound notes: slower pentatonic bowls.

2) Fold (`domains/fold/`)
- Goal: reinterpret geometry as paper folds and creases.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: symmetry stability, crease depth, paper snap.
- Visual language notes: paper shading, mountain/valley lines, reduced neon.
- Sound notes: soft paper clicks, warm bowls.

3) Gravity (`domains/gravity/`)
- Goal: feel mass, sag, and structural balance.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: balance tension, edge strain, settling.
- Visual language notes: weighted lines, subtle droop cues.
- Sound notes: low, grounded tones.

4) Architecture (`domains/architecture/`)
- Goal: explore plans, frames, and circulation flow.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: symmetry halo, edge whispers, calm breathing.
- Visual language notes: blueprint-like accents, room-like loops.
- Sound notes: clean sine tones with subtle shimmer.

5) Machines (`domains/machines/`)
- Goal: treat shapes as machines and state programs.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: loop settle, excited state, memory trails.
- Visual language notes: servo pulses, disciplined rings, minimal linework.
- Sound notes: mechanical but soft harmonics.

6) Electrons (`domains/electrons/`)
- Goal: discover fields, repulsion, and equilibrium.
- Core behaviors to emphasize: orbit whispers, emission wave, balance field.
- Visual language notes: faint particle glows, field ripples.
- Sound notes: delicate, higher overtones.

## Notes
- Each domain should preserve the no-instruction, toy-like feel.
- Domains are additive layers on the core engine; avoid forking the engine.
