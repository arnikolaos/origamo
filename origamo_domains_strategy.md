# Origamo Domains & Engine Strategy
**Status:** Conceptual architecture  
**Engine:** Origamo (locked)  
**Audience:** Kids (primary), creatives, educators (secondary)

---

## 0. Executive Summary

Origamo is complete as an interaction engine, but curiosity alone does not sustain long-term engagement.
To transform Origamo into a compelling, return-worthy experience, it must evolve from a single playground into a **multi-domain system**.

Origamo will remain the **core kinetic engine**.
Meaning, progression, and narrative will emerge through **Domains**—distinct interpretive layers that reuse the same interactions but apply different conceptual rules.

This document defines:
- why Domains are needed,
- how they work structurally,
- which Domains to build,
- and how this enables Phase 2 products and marketing.

---

## 1. Core Insight

### Problem Identified
- Kids explore Origamo once out of curiosity.
- Interest drops the next day.
- Cause: no unfolding meaning, memory, or purpose over time.

### Key Realization
The issue is not interaction quality.
The issue is **lack of interpretive context**.

Kids do not return to tools.
They return to **worlds**.

---

## 2. Origamo as an Engine (Locked)

Origamo is defined as:

> A kinetic shape engine where geometry becomes a movement program and motion produces form.

### Engine Responsibilities
- Vertex manipulation
- Angle logic
- Motion tracing
- Kinetic feedback
- Symmetry detection
- Emergent behavior

### Engine Non-Responsibilities
- Goals
- Narratives
- Subject-matter framing
- Explicit teaching

Origamo must remain:
- neutral
- abstract
- reusable

---

## 3. Domains: Definition

A **Domain** is a lens that:
- reinterprets the same Origamo interactions,
- applies new conceptual rules,
- introduces meaning without changing controls.

**Key rule:**
> The user never “learns a new tool.”  
> The tool *means something different*.

---

## 4. Domain System Architecture

### Shared Across All Domains
- Same canvas
- Same gestures
- Same vertices, edges, motion
- Same Origamo engine

### Domain-Specific Layers
- Interpretation of shape
- Feedback language (visual + sound)
- Soft prompts / discoveries
- Success/failure meaning

---

## 5. Domain 1: Geometry (Baseline)

### Role
Foundation domain. Already partially implemented.

### Interpretation
- Shapes are geometric objects.
- Symmetry is harmony.
- Closure is resolution.

### Soft Discoveries
- “This shape closes.”
- “This one never repeats.”
- “This one balances perfectly.”

### Purpose
- Establish trust
- Teach the rules implicitly
- Serve as reference frame for other domains

---

## 6. Domain 2: Origami / Folding Space

### Interpretation
- Vertices = fold points
- Edges = creases
- Motion = fold sequence

### Key Concept
> The user is folding space, not drawing shapes.

### Behavior Changes
- High symmetry → stable fold
- Asymmetry → collapse or twist
- Repeated motion → layered folds

### Feedback
- Surfaces appear to hinge
- Depth cues emerge
- Collapse is gentle, not punitive

### Cognitive Impact
- Spatial reasoning
- 2D → 3D intuition
- Structural thinking

---

## 7. Domain 3: Physics (Gravity & Electrons)

### Interpretation
Shapes become physical systems.

---

### 3A. Gravity Mode

#### Rules
- Vertices have mass
- Edges act as beams
- Gravity pulls downward

#### Outcomes
- Symmetry resists collapse
- Long spans bend
- Balanced forms settle

#### Learning (Implicit)
- Load distribution
- Structural stability
- Center of mass

---

### 3B. Electron / Field Mode

#### Rules
- Vertices repel each other
- Edges constrain distance
- System seeks equilibrium

#### Outcomes
- Oscillation
- Stable configurations
- Chaotic motion when unbalanced

#### Learning (Implicit)
- Fields
- Energy minimization
- Emergent order

---

## 8. Domain 4: Architecture

### Interpretation
Shapes are **plans, frames, or circulation systems**.

### Rules
- Closed loops = rooms
- Symmetry = structural efficiency
- Irregularity = stress

### Feedback
- “This could stand.”
- “This collapses.”
- “This flows.”

(no explicit text required—can be visual or sonic)

### Strategic Importance
- Deep engagement
- Long-term retention
- Bridges play with real-world creativity

This domain aligns strongly with architectural intuition and design thinking.

---

## 9. Domain 5: Logic & Machines

### Interpretation
Shapes are **machines or programs**.

- Vertex = state
- Edge = transition
- Loop = cycle

### Behavior
- Certain shapes behave predictably
- Others oscillate or deadlock
- Small changes = large behavioral shifts

### Outcome
Kids begin to design **behavior**, not form.

This is programming intuition without syntax.

---

## 10. Memory & Retention Layer (Critical)

Domains alone are not enough.
Origamo must remember.

### Local Memory (No Accounts)
- Shape journal
- Saved “machines”
- Discovered states

### Why This Matters
Kids return to:
- continue something
- refine something
- show something

Memory transforms play into **practice**.

---

## 11. Phase 2: Engine-Based Products

Once Domains are validated, Origamo becomes a **platform**.

### Spin-off Experiences (Examples)

#### Fold the City
- Origami + Architecture
- Build cities by folding space
- Urban intuition through play

#### Gravity Paper
- Physics + Folding
- Structures under gravity
- Calm, meditative physics exploration

#### Living Machines
- Logic + Motion
- Design kinetic organisms
- Behavior-first creativity

These are not new engines.
They are **stories built on Origamo**.

---

## 12. Marketing Insight (Future)

Origamo is not marketed as a game.

It is positioned as:
- an engine
- a creative instrument
- a thinking playground

Phase 2 products become:
- named worlds
- focused experiences
- entry points for different minds

---

## 13. Strategic Conclusion

Do not rebuild Origamo.
Do not gamify Origamo.

Instead:
- elevate Origamo to engine status,
- add Domains as meaning layers,
- allow products to emerge from the engine.

This preserves depth, elegance, and long-term value.

---

## 14. Next Implementation Priority

Recommended order:
1. Geometry (formalize)
2. Origami / Fold
3. Gravity
4. Architecture
5. Machines

Each domain should:
- reuse all interactions,
- add only interpretation and feedback,
- never add instructions.
